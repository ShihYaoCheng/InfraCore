This project is a Terraform-based infrastructure automation system designed to deploy cloud environments across multiple regions and stages (dev, QA, prod). It manages the provisioning and configuration of core cloud components including GKE clusters, VPCs, databases, and load balancers.

While I was not the primary owner of this project, I collaborated with the DevOps lead and contributed to the environment-specific configuration and cloud resource definitions.

Key Features:

Infrastructure as Code using Terraform modules

Supports multiple deployment environments: Dev, QA, Prod

Configured for global deployment: Taiwan, Singapore, London, Los Angeles

Manages GKE clusters, VPC networks, databases, and load balancers

Version-controlled and automated via GitLab pipelines

Tech Stack: Terraform, GCP, GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine), GitLab CI/CD, YAML
